# Harbour_simplest_neural_network
The simplest neuronal network you can implement using Harbour code

This code was ported into Harbour language from a C language example shown from the OpenAI playground. The code does not appear on google neither on github and has no copyright, so there is no way to know where OpenAI GPT-3 took it from or simply implemented it itself:
